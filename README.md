Thank you for taking the time to view my submission. 

I decided to use SQL and Visual Studio to create a dynamic website for this challenge. The buttons show linked SQL Queries when clicked, so the generated tables have the correct answer at the top.

Both of these were new technologies for me, so learning how to use them was exciting. I chose Visual Studio so I could use their GUI editor as well. 


They sometimes take a long time to load when executing the queries.
